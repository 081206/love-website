        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
            We first met in a group chat on Instagram on <strong>12th November 2024</strong>.  
            Then on <strong>13th November 2024</strong>, we spoke for the very first time in DMs.  
            That day marked the beginning of something truly beautiful — our journey as Bubuuu & Cherry 💌  
            <br><br>

            On 14th June 2025, a truly unforgettable chapter was written in our story — we finally met in person for the first time. We met in Delhi and spent our time exploring the historic Red Fort together. The way we talked, laughed, and shared those beautiful moments made everything feel so magical. It was more than just a day — it was the beginning of a new phase in our journey, one we had been dreaming about for so long.
            <br><br>

            There have been so many special moments where her love for me felt so deep and pure.  
            In those moments, I felt truly loved and lucky. 🥺❤️  
            <br><br>

            I remember how she made me feel included even when we were far apart —  
            like when she went on family trips, but still made me feel like I was with her.  
            She sent me videos, shared moments, and gave me the feeling of being right beside her.  
            <br><br>

            🏞 She went to **Vrindavan** on <strong>6th January 2025</strong> — her first trip I felt a part of.  
            <br>
            🌊 Then she visited the **Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj** on <strong>25th January 2025</strong>.  
            <br>
            🌳 And most recently, she went to **Chitrakoot** on <strong>24th April 2025</strong>.  
            <br><br>

            Even though I wasn't physically there, the way she included me made every trip unforgettable.  
            That's the magic of our love — distance never wins when hearts are this close.  
            <br><br>

            This is *our* love story, Bubuuu — and it's just the beginning 💖
